# Reactive Extensions (Rx) in Action 

You may have seen the theoretical discussions of Reactive Extensions and heard about the duality of IEnumerable and IObservable, but are still scratching your head to know how and when to use them. In demo filled session, we'll cover a number of cases where it makes sense to consider RX to declaratively compose complex operations over observable sequences in an elegant LINQ like syntax. We may even have some chocolate induced audience participation along the way.
