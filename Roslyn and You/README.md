# .NET Compiler Platform (Roslyn) and You 

Over the last five years, the C# and VB compilers were re-written from the ground up. Visual Studio 2015 includes this new compiler and features new extensibility and language capabilities. In this session, we will focus on how these changes will impact you as a C# or VB developer in your day-to-day development. We'll start with exploring the new language features. We'll then look at how to take advantage of code diagnostics and fixes that are publically available. We'll end by exploring some of the extensibility points that you can take advantage of if you want to build your own diagnostics and code fixes.
