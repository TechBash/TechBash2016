# What's New In C# 7

*Presented at TechBash 2016*



## Abstract

It's never been a more exciting time to be a C# developer as the language has shifted from being a proprietary Microsoft technology to an open source project with a new modern compiler service which makes it easier and quicker to add new features. C# 7 builds on this framework to bring us new syntax for working with data structures in a more functional-like and friction-less way, allowing us to reduce our boiler plate code and more clearly express our intent.



In this session, you'll learn the new C# 7 syntax through code demos and see how the new features such as tuples and pattern matching can help simplify common coding patterns.

## Code Prerequisites

The source code for this presentation was written for Visual Studio 15 Preview 4. It will not work in older versions and may not work in newer versions, as the language features for C# 7 are still being developed.
